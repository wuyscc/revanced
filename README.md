## Easily install or update ReVanced/Morphe apps with Obtainium
You can easily install or keep your ReVanced/Morphe apps up to date by using [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium), which lets you install and update apps directly from the source and receive notifications when new releases are available.

#### Here is a quick tutorial on how to add them to Obtainium:

> [!NOTE]
> In step 3, you need to enter the regular expression that corresponds to the application you want to install:
> - YouTube ReVanced: `youtube-revanced-v`
> - YouTube Music ReVanced: `yt-music-revanced-v`
> - YouTube ReVanced anddea: `youtube-revanced-anddea`
> - YouTube Music ReVanced anddea: `yt-music-revanced-anddea`
> - YouTube Morphe: `youtube-morphe`
> - YouTube Music Morphe: `yt-music-morphe`

## Import custom settings in ReVanced/Morphe applications
I personally like my YouTube and YouTube Music applications to be as close as possible to the original look, but less cluttered, easier, and less annoying to use. If you feel the same, I highly recommend importing [my custom settings files](https://github.com/peternmuller/revanced-morphe-builder/tree/main/custom-settings).

**To do this, go to YouTube Settings &rarr; ReVanced/ReVanced Extended/Morphe &rarr; Miscellaneous &rarr; Import&nbsp;/&nbsp;Export settings.**

## If you are having trouble with the classic mount method of the modules
such as,
- **"Reflash needed"** error after reboots
- **"Suspicious mount detected"** warnings from root detector apps

You can consider using [rvmm-zygisk-mount](https://github.com/j-hc/rvmm-zygisk-mount)
